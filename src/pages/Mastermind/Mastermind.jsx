                <h3>Description and brief</h3>
                <p>This was my first project with the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course 
                    where we were given just under a week to create a browser game. I opted with Mastermind, 
                    a code breaking game where the player tries to crack the hidden code through guesses and 
                    logical thinking, as this was a game I always used to play with family when I was younger. 
                    I also chose this game as I felt it was the right level of challenge for me at the stage I 
                    was in in my coding journey. I was interested in particular in comparing  the guesses with 
                    the code, so that I could then provide clues to show how close they are to cracking the code.</p>
