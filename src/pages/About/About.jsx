                    I’ve primarily been working within the insurance industry in customer service 
                    with a spell working in the film industry as a camera assistant and some passion 
                    projects editing videos. Beyond wanting what’s best for myself, the best for everyone 
                    else is at the core of my thoughts and actions day to day.

                    Humans are complex and every individual has their own needs separate from the rest, my goal is to reach out 
                    to humans in every corner of the globe as best I can. I took the next step into 
                    programming as I believe I can achieve this best with the capability to create anything
                    I desire, or even anything I believe the public would desire. Having full control over
                    creating the closest application possible to perfect; making people’s lives easier and simpler.
